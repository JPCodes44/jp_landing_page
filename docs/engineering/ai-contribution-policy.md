# AI Contribution Policy

## Why This Exists

Every agent that touches this codebase must be auditable. We need to know:
- What task it was given
- What files it was allowed to touch
- Whether it introduced secrets or scope creep
- That a human approved the result before merge

This policy defines the system that enforces those guarantees.

---

## Agent Lifecycle

```
1. Spec       →  Write .agents/specs/active/<task-slug>.md
2. Worktree   →  Run scripts/create_agent_worktree.sh <task-slug>
3. Implement  →  Work only on files in APPROVED_FILES
4. Gate       →  Run scripts/run_quality_gates.sh and fix any failures
5. PR         →  Open a pull request from agent/<task-slug> to main
6. Review     →  Human or reviewer agent approves per reviewer-policy.md
7. Merge      →  Squash merge only, referencing the spec task name
```

---

## Creating a Task

```bash
# From the repo root
./scripts/create_agent_worktree.sh <task-slug>
```

This will:
1. Copy `.agents/specs/TEMPLATE.md` to `.agents/specs/active/<task-slug>.md`
2. Create a new git worktree at `../<repo>-<task-slug>` on branch `agent/<task-slug>`
3. Configure the worktree to use `.githooks/` for local enforcement

After running the script:
- Open the spec and fill in `TASK`, `APPROVED_FILES`, and `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA`
- Change into the worktree directory
- Begin implementation

## Gates

All gates live in `scripts/run_quality_gates.sh`. They run automatically via git hooks and CI.

| Gate | When | What it checks |
|------|------|----------------|
| `verify_no_secrets` | Always | Staged/changed files for credentials, keys, tokens |
| `verify_spec_header` | agent/* branches | Spec exists with all required fields populated |
| `verify_changed_files` | agent/* branches | All changed files are listed in `APPROVED_FILES` |

### Pre-commit hook
Runs `--staged` gates. Blocks commit if any gate fails.

### Commit-msg hook
Validates message is ≥10 chars and not a generic word like "fix" or "wip".

### Pre-push hook
Blocks direct push to `main` from agent branches. Runs `--pr` gates.

### CI (GitHub Actions)
- `ci.yml`: runs gates on every push and PR to main
- `pr-agent-audit.yml`: runs detailed audit on `agent/*` PRs and posts a summary comment

---

## When Gates Fail

1. Read the gate output carefully — it names the specific file or field that failed
2. Fix the underlying issue (don't bypass hooks with `--no-verify`)
3. Re-stage and attempt the commit again
4. If you cannot resolve it: log the failure in `.agents/logs/`, surface it to a human

Never use `--no-verify` or `--skip`. If a gate is wrong, fix the gate — open a PR to update the scripts.

## Spec Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `TASK` | Yes | One-line description of what the agent will do |
| `BRANCH` | Yes | Must be `agent/<task-slug>` |
| `WORKTREE` | Yes | Path to the worktree |
| `APPROVED_FILES` | Yes | Exhaustive list of files the agent may touch (globs allowed) |
| `ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA` | Yes | Checklist items the reviewer will verify |
| `NOTES` | No | Caveats, dependencies, research references |

---

## Roles

- **Scout agent**: Read-only research. Outputs findings to `.agents/learnings/` and a spec draft. See `scout-policy.md`.
- **Implementing agent**: Follows the spec, touches only approved files, opens the PR.
- **Reviewer agent/human**: Verifies gates passed, spec matches diff, criteria are met. See `reviewer-policy.md`.
